/**
 * Per-PTY "is a command currently running" tracker.
 *
 * Source: the backend OSC 133 segmenter sets `command_running=true`
 * between an OSC 133 C marker (command start) and the next OSC 133 D
 * marker (command done). BlockTerminal sees this on every frame and
 * calls `setTerminalRunning(ptyId, frame.command_running)` so the
 * sidebar's worktree spinner can light up whenever ANY pty in the
 * worktree has an active command — `npm run build`, `pytest`, a long
 * `find`, whatever.
 *
 * This is the same signal Warp uses for its per-block spinner: OSC 133
 * is the standard shell-integration marker for "command is processing
 * vs. waiting at prompt". It does NOT remain true while the user is
 * sitting at the shell prompt or while a TUI agent (claude/codex) is
 * idle inside its own input box — those are the cases the user
 * specifically called out as "spinner shouldn't be on right now".
 *
 * For Claude specifically we ALSO OR in transcript-file mtime polling
 * (`agentActivityStore`) so the spinner reflects active agent turns
 * even when claude's TUI doesn't emit OSC 133 between turns.

/**
 * Global poll loop that asks the Rust backend which PTY sessions
 * currently have `last_command_running=true`, and reconciles the

 * path: the per-worktree TerminalKeepaliveLayer only mounts the
 * active worktree's BlockTerminals, so without this poll a
 * `npm run build` in a background worktree's PTY would have no
 * way to surface its running state to the sidebar spinner.
 *
 * Mounted BlockTerminals also call `setTerminalRunning` directly
 * from their per-frame effect — that path is lower-latency (no
 * 500 ms poll gap) and authoritative when both paths agree. The
 * poll just covers the unmounted case. Both write the same
 * underlying `states` map.
 *
 * 500 ms poll cadence: matches the user-perceived "is something
 * happening" tempo while keeping the IPC volume well below the
 * frame-emit budget. The Rust side is O(N) over open sessions and
 * a few microseconds in practice, so this is cheap.
