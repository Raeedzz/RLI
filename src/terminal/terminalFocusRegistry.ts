/**
 * Terminal focus registry.
 *
 * Module-scoped lookup table mapping a terminal tab id → a focus
 * function. Each `BlockTerminal` instance registers its focus fn on
 * mount and unregisters on unmount. The `useFocusActiveTerminal` hook
 * looks up the active worktree's primary terminal tab id and calls
 * its focus fn whenever the active worktree changes — so switching
 * worktrees in the sidebar always lands keyboard input on the main
 * terminal, never on a leftover focus target (the right panel, a
 * secondary terminal, the URL bar, etc.).
 *
 * The registered function is responsible for choosing the correct
 * inner element to focus (PromptInput textarea when the foreground is
 * a shell, the PtyPassthrough invisible input when it's an interactive
 * agent). The registry doesn't know or care about that — it just calls
 * the function.
 *
 * The fn is registered ONCE per BlockTerminal mount (keyed by tab id)
 * even though the foreground-agent state flips frequently; BlockTerminal
 * keeps a ref to the current foreground state so the same registered
 * closure reads the latest value without re-registering on every flip.
