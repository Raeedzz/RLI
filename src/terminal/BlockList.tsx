/**
 * Bottom-anchored scrollable column of closed blocks. Newest closed
 * block sits flush at the bottom; older blocks stack above with the
 * oldest at the top. The currently-running command lives in
 * `LiveBlock` rendered just below this list — by the time a block
 * shows up here, it's frozen.
 *
 * `flex-direction: column-reverse` does the bottom-anchoring for free
 * (browser stacks DOM source order from the bottom up), so we
 * iterate newest-first to put it at source[0] (= bottom of stack).
 * The scroll position naturally pins at the bottom: no scrollIntoView
 * jitter, no autoscroll race.
