/**
 * Reports the set of currently-visible terminal PTYs to the backend
 * so the per-session frame throttle can drop hidden terminals from
 * 60 Hz down to 4 Hz. Mounted at the AppShell level — fires whenever
 * the active worktree, active tab, or secondary terminal selection
 * changes.
 *
 * "Visible" here means: actually showing a `BlockTerminal` in the
 * current UI. Concretely that's:
 *
 *   1. The active worktree's currently-active main-column tab,
 *      if it's a terminal-kind tab. (Other tabs are non-terminal —
 *      markdown, diff, etc. — so they don't contribute a PTY.)
 *   2. The active worktree's active secondary terminal, IF the
 *      secondary panel is expanded AND on the Terminal subtab.
 *
 * Every PTY NOT in this set runs at the hidden throttle. With 20
 * worktrees open and one active terminal visible, that's 19 PTYs
 * emitting at 4 Hz instead of 60 Hz — a ~15× reduction in the
 * event flux that React doesn't need anyway, freeing the main
 * thread for the visible terminal's input + rendering.
 *
 * Idempotency: the hook caches the last-sent sorted set as a single
 * pipe-delimited string and skips the `invoke()` when nothing
 * changed. State updates that don't touch the active-tab axis (poll
 * results, badge changes, …) therefore generate zero IPC traffic.
