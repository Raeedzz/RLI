//! Terminal emulator backed by `alacritty_terminal`.
//!
//! Replaces the previous xterm.js-driven `pty.rs`. The Rust side now owns
//! the full terminal grid: a VTE parser feeds PTY bytes into an Alacritty
//! `Term`, we walk the grid into compressed RGB-colored span runs, and
//! emit frame deltas + closed-block events to the frontend over Tauri
//! events. The frontend renders cells as DOM (one styled `<span>` per
//! run), giving us per-cell control for the Warp-style block UI.
//!
//! Key invariants:
//!   * One reader thread per session does PTY reads → VTE parse → frame
//!     diff. All Term mutation lives on that thread; command handlers
//!     only mutate via the shared `Mutex<Session>` (resize, write).
//!   * Frames are throttled to ~60 Hz — heavy output (`seq 1 100000`)
//!     coalesces instead of overwhelming the IPC channel.
//!   * `BlockSegmenter` scans the raw byte stream (parallel to VTE) for
//!     OSC 133 prompt markers AND for Warp-style DCS hooks of the form
//!     `ESC P gli ; <hook_name> ; <json_payload> ESC \`. The DCS hooks
//!     carry richer metadata (the exact typed command, precise start
//!     timestamp, exact exit code + duration as measured by the shell)
//!     that enrich the resulting `ClosedBlock`. OSC 133 stays as the
//!     compat fallback for shells where DCS hooks aren't installed.
//!     Closed blocks emit their own event. Unmarked shells get an
//!     idle-quiescence fallback.
//!   * When the Term is in alt-screen mode (vim, htop, claude TUI), the
//!     segmenter pauses and the frontend swaps from BlockList to FullGrid.

/* ------------------------------------------------------------------
   Frame snapshot — walk the grid and compress styled runs.
   ------------------------------------------------------------------

   This is the HOT path: called on every frame for every visible
   terminal, including the 60+ Hz live agent stream. It walks
   alacritty's grid directly (no intermediate FlatStorage allocation)
   to keep the per-frame cost minimal.

   Earlier the path was alacritty → FlatStorage → RowSnapshot via
   alac_adapter — that worked but allocated ~3000 Strings per frame
   per terminal, visibly slowing agent load times. The FlatStorage
   bridge stays alive in `alac_adapter` (used by tests + scrollback
   capture); only the live snapshot path went back to direct.

   `flat_storage_to_row_snapshots` is still exported for the day
   FlatTerm replaces alacritty in Session — at that point the input
   becomes a FlatStorage owned by FlatTerm and this function vanishes
   in favor of `flat_storage_to_row_snapshots`. The parity tests in
   `flat_storage_path_matches_legacy_*` lock the two paths together
   so the eventual swap is provably equivalent. */

    //         then installs the trap DEBUG / PROMPT_COMMAND hooks.

    //         pass `-i` to be safe even when the spawn cwd is set.

       These tests lock the JSON shape the frontend sends when it
       calls `invoke("term_start", ...)` (and friends). They exist
       because we hit a runtime bug where the JS side sent
       `frameChannel` as a top-level arg key while the Rust command
       expected `frame_channel` — Tauri's name-matching for
       `Channel<T>` args doesn't auto-convert across the case
       boundary, so the bug only surfaced as a "missing required key"
       error the moment a terminal tried to start. Locking the shape
       here means a future schema change has to update BOTH the Rust
